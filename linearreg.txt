Linear Regression for Weather Prediction AI:
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to find relationships between variables by fitting a line through data points. 
It is particularly effective in predicting trends over time. In this project, we use Linear Regression to predict the average temperature for the next 
seven days based on historical weather data.

Introduction to Linear Regression in Weather Prediction
Linear Regression estimates future values by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., average temperature) and an independent 
variable (e.g., date). The algorithm calculates the best-fit line by minimizing the error between the actual data points and the predicted values. This 
approach is ideal for weather forecasting, where historical temperature trends provide a reliable basis for prediction.

The Linear Regression Equation
The equation of a straight line used in Linear Regression is:
y = mx + b

y: Predicted value (e.g., temperature)
m: Slope of the line (rate of change)
x: Independent variable (e.g., date as an ordinal value)
b: Intercept (starting value of y when x = 0)
The slope (m) is calculated as:
m = Σ((x - x̄) * (y - ȳ)) / Σ((x - x̄)²)

The intercept (b) is calculated as:
b = ȳ - (m * x̄)

Where:

x̄: Mean of x values
ȳ: Mean of y values
Solved Example
Problem: Predict the temperature for Day 6 based on the following data:

Day	Temperature (°C)
1	20
2	22
3	23
4	25
5	24

Solution:
Convert Day into x and Temperature into y.
Compute means:
x̄ = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 3
ȳ = (20 + 22 + 23 + 25 + 24) / 5 = 22.8
Calculate slope (m):
m = Σ((x - x̄) * (y - ȳ)) / Σ((x - x̄)²) = (2 + 1.6 + 0.2 - 0.4 - 2.8) / (4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4) = 0.8
Calculate intercept (b):
b = ȳ - (m * x̄) = 22.8 - (0.8 * 3) = 20.4
Predict for Day 6:
y = mx + b = (0.8 * 6) + 20.4 = 25.2°C
Result: The predicted temperature for Day 6 is 25.2°C.
